   TYPES OF SUPERVISED LEARNING

1
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?. Which of the following statements are true?

Supervised learning problems can be grouped into clustering and association.

There are two major types of supervised learning problems, called clustering and regression.

Supervised learning is used when we want to predict a certain outcome from a given input.

The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data.

Correct ans : c ,d

Suppose you want to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a superhero will fly or not. Which of the following statements are true?

A regression model is the best way to predict the probability to fly.

This is not a machine learning problem

A classification model provide the best approach.

We'll use unlabeled examples to train the model.

Correct ans: c
