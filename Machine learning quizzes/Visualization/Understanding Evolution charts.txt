True or False: This plot created using the temperature dataset is an example of an evolution chart.

# Plotting temperature against itself to create a meaningless plot

ax.plot(temperature_data['Temp'], temperature_data['Temp'], color='purple', label='Incorrect Plot')
ax.set_title('Incorrect Time Series Plot')
ax.set_xlabel('Temperature')
ax.set_ylabel('Temperature')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
